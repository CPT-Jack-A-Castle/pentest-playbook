# Invoke a function without parentheses

Let's assume you have this function defined:

```text
function greet() {
    console.log('hello');
}
```

Then here follow some ways to call `greet` without parentheses:

### 1. As Constructor

With `new` you can invoke a function without parentheses:

```text
new greet; // parentheses are optional in this construct.
```

From [MDN on the `new` oprator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new):

> **Syntax**
>
> ```text
> new constructor[([arguments])]
> ```

### 2. As `toString` or `valueOf` Implementation

[`toString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString) and [`valueOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/valueOf) are special methods: they get called implicitly when a conversion is necessary:

```text
var obj = {
    toString: function() {
         return 'hello';
    }
}

'' + obj; // concatenation forces cast to string and call to toString.
```

You could \(ab\)use this pattern to call `greet` without parentheses:

```text
'' + { toString: greet };
```

Or with `valueOf`:

```text
+{ valueOf: greet };
```

`valueOf` and `toString` are in fact called from the [@@toPrimitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/toPrimitive) method \(since ES6\), and so you can also implement _that_ method:

```text
+{ [Symbol.toPrimitive]: greet }
"" + { [Symbol.toPrimitive]: greet }
```

#### 2.b Overriding `valueOf` in Function Prototype

You could take the previous idea to override the `valueOf` method on the [`Function` prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/prototype):

```text
Function.prototype.valueOf = function() {
    this.call(this);
    // Optional improvement: avoid `NaN` issues when used in expressions.
    return 0; 
};
```

Once you have done that, you can write:

```text
+greet;
```

And although there are parentheses involved down the line, the actual triggering invocation has no parentheses. See more about this in the blog ["Calling methods in JavaScript, without really calling them"](http://www.tapper-ware.net/blog/?p=87)

### 3. As Generator

You could define a [generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) \(with `*`\), which returns an [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterator). You can call it using the [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) or with the [`for...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) syntax.

First we need a generator variant of the original `greet` function:

```text
function* greet_gen() {
    console.log('hello');
}
```

And then we call it without parentheses by defining the [@@iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator) method:

```text
[...{ [Symbol.iterator]: greet_gen }];
```

Normally generators would have a [`yield`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield) keyword somewhere, but it is not needed for the function to get called.

The last statement invokes the function, but that could also be done with [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment):

```text
[,] = { [Symbol.iterator]: greet_gen };
```

or a `for ... of` construct, but it has parentheses of its own:

```text
for ({} of { [Symbol.iterator]: greet_gen });
```

Note that you _can_ do the above with the original `greet` function as well, but it will trigger an exception in the process, _after_ `greet` has been executed \(tested on FF and Chrome\). You could manage the exception with a `try...catch` block.

### 4. As Getter

@jehna1 has a full answer on this, so give him credit. Here is a way to call a function _parentheses-less_ on the global scope, avoiding the [deprecated `__defineGetter__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/__defineGetter__) method. It uses [`Object.defineProperty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) instead.

We need to create a variant of the original `greet` function for this:

```text
Object.defineProperty(window, 'greet_get', { get: greet });
```

And then:

```text
greet_get;
```

Replace `window` with whatever your global object is.

You could call the original `greet` function without leaving a trace on the global object like this:

```text
Object.defineProperty({}, 'greet', { get: greet }).greet;
```

But one could argue we do have parentheses here \(although they are not involved in the actual invocation\).

### 5. As Tag Function

Since ES6 you can call a function passing it a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) with this syntax:

```text
greet``;
```

See ["Tagged Template Literals"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates).

### 6. As Proxy Handler

Since ES6, you can define a [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy):

```text
var proxy = new Proxy({}, { get: greet } );
```

And then reading any property value will invoke `greet`:

```text
proxy._; // even if property not defined, it still triggers greet
```

There are many variations of this. One more example:

```text
var proxy = new Proxy({}, { has: greet } );

1 in proxy; // triggers greet
```

#### 7. As instance checker

The `instanceof` operator executes the `@@hasInstance` method on the second operand, when defined:

```text
1 instanceof { [Symbol.hasInstance]: greet } // triggers greet
```
