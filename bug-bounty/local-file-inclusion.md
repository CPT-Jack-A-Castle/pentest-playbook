# Local file inclusion \(LFI\)

## What does it mean?

* You can expose a file from the web server's file system via the url
* LFI can lead to accessing \(without the proper permissions\) important and classified data

## What are the signs of this bug?

* You should keep an eye for http parameters that contain a file name value 
* It is commonly found in PHP based websites but isn't restricted to them

## How can I find it?

* Try to include the passwd file on the Linux system i.e `/etc/passwd`
* The most common technique is path traversal method meaning we can include files like `../../../../etc/passwd` what this does it get out of a directory like we usually do in Linux system by running cd ../
