# Web Cache Deception

Web cache deception is a new web attack vector that affects various technologies, such as web frameworks and caching mechanisms. Attackers can use this method to expose private and sensitive information of application users, and in certain cases may be able to leverage this attack to perform a complete account takeover. The attack takes advantage of default behaviors and poor configurations of various technologies that are involved in the application's architecture. A user who accesses an innocent-looking URL to the domain of a vulnerable application causes the accessed page, with the userâ€™s private information, to be stored by a caching mechanism that serves the web application.
