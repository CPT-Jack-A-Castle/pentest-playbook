* Via Laravel Installer
    * First, download the Laravel installer using Composer:
```

composer global require laravel/installer

```text
*Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your $PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system. This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:*

__macOS and GNU / Linux Distributions: $HOME/.composer/vendor/bin__
__Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin__


    * Add the following to .bashrc file (not .bash_profile).
```

export PATH="~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"

```text
*At the end of the file and then in terminal*
```

source ~/.bashrc

```text
*To verify that:*
```

echo $PATH \(Restart the terminal, Check & Confirm the path is there\)

```text
*Run the laravel command!*
```

nano ~/.bashrc
