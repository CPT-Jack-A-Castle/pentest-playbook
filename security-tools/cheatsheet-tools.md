## Steganography
 - [steghide](https://github.com/StefanoDeVuono/steghide) - Steghide is one of the most famous steganography tools, and for good reason. It's a classic method, hiding a message inside an image, and steghide does it effectively and efficiently. A downside of steghide is that it only works on jpgs; however, that means that if you believe there is a hidden message inside a jpg, then steghide is a probable option. One of the greatest benefits of stegohide, is that it can encrypt data with a passphrase. Meaning that if they don't have the password then they can't extract any data.
 - zsteg - Zsteg is to png's what steghide is to jpg's. It supports various techniques to extract any and all data from png files. zsteg also supports BMP files, but it is primarily used for png's.
 - exiftool - Exiftool is a tool that allows you to view and edit image metadata. While this in itself is not a stego tool, I would be remiss not to include at least a footnote on it as one of the most popular forms of image stego is to hide messages in the metadata.
 - stegcracker - 
 - stegoveritas - This tool supports every image file and is able to extract all types of data from it. Stegoveritas has other features as well such as color correcting images
