# Install JDK on Linux Mint

## Mint comes with a OpenJDK version of java libraries, which shouldn't be used for example Android development. \[1\]

* Open up the Terminal \(Alt + F2 &gt; Terminal\).
* Remove OpenJDK installation.

  ```text
  sudo apt-get update && apt-get remove openjdk*
  ```

* Download Oracle JDK from here. You are looking for a linux version with tar.gz extension. Also choose the right version from 32-bit \(x86\) and 64bit \(x64\) one.
* Change directory into one with downloaded tarball. In my case $HOME/Downloads.

  ```text
  cd ~/Downloads
  ```

* Extract tarball. Replace with a name of dowloaded file. \(just press Tab and it will be autocompleted.\)

  ```text
  tar -zxvf jdk-
  ```

* As a root create a folder in /opt where jdk will be stored.

  ```text
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/java
  ```

* Move extracted folder to /opt/java. In my case, version number was 1.7.0\_25.

  ```text
  sudo mv jdk1.7.0_25 /opt/java
  ```

* Make JDK system default.

  ```text
  sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/java/jdk1.7.0_25/bin/java" 1
  sudo update-alternatives --set java /opt/java/jdk1.7.0_25/bin/java
  ```

* Test installed java version.

  ```text
  $ java -version
  java version "1.7.0_25" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_25-b15) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.25-b01, mixed mode)
  ```

  _Optinaly install firefox plugin by linking **libnpjp2.so file to ~/.mozzila/plugins** folder._

  ```text
  mkdir -p ~/.mozzila/plugins
  ln -s /opt/java/jdk1.7.0_25/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozzila/plugins/
  ```
