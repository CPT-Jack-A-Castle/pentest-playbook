# Proxychains

Proxychains is a tool that forces every TCP communication coming out of your system to go through different proxies. As the name suggests, you can chain multiple proxies with the Proxychains and your connection will go through these different proxies before reaching your target. This method of chaining proxies gives you much more anonymity than a standard VPN. It also has the option to mitigate the DNS leak problem. With a Proxychain, you can configure different proxy protocols such as SOCKS 4, SOCKS 5, and HTTPS. You can even configure Tor proxy with it. You need to have servers with these aforementioned proxy protocols to work with the proxychains.

Proxychains is a tool that is written only for GNU/Linux systems, so if you are using Windows, you need to find some alternatives. The Proxychains is installed by default on Kali and some other distributions. If you don’t have Proxychains pre-installed, then you can download it from the repository using your package manager tool. I am on Ubuntu, so I use the ‘apt’ command to install the software.

```bash
sudo apt install proxychains
```

You should also install Tor if you intend to use the tor proxy with proxychains.

```bash
sudo apt install tor
```

Once you install Proxychains, you can configure the tool with its configuration file. The `proxychians.conf` file is located in the `/etc/proxychains.conf`. Open this file with your favorite text editor.

```bash
cd /etc/$nano proxychains.conf
```

Once you open it, you will see that there are different ways to configure the chain of proxies such as dynamic, random, and strict. You can comment or uncomment the name\(dynamic\_chain, random\_chain, strict\_chain\) to enable or disable the specific option. I am using the dynamic\_chain option to route packets through the proxies. If you scroll down a bit, there will be a line “Proxy DNS requests — no leaks for DNS” commented. You should remove the hashtag to prevent DNS leak while using the proxychains. Scroll down further to see the list where you can add your proxies. The file also gives you some examples of how to add the proxies. By default, the Proxychains use tor. If you don’t want to use tor, you can comment out the first line out and add your own proxies.

```bash
proxychains firefox
```

The above command will open firefox and force all the TCP connections to go through the proxies that you configured in the file. You can see how the connections work in the terminal.

If you wish to use the Tor proxy, leave the default proxy configuration list in the proxychains.conf file. By default, the Proxychains send the traffic through our localhost on the port 9050. It is the default Tor configuration port. So you need to start the Tor service on your system and you can use proxychains with your browser. Now, all the connections will go through the tor network.

```bash
sudo service tor start
```

You can also link other proxies with the Tor to get better anonymity.

You may think that using Proxychains is going overboard to stay anonymous. I completely agree. For normal users, VPN does all the job for them. Proxychains shines in providing complete anonymity for people working in the cybersecurity domain. You should not leave any trail of your system when you are pen-testing, data sniffing, etc. That is why proxychain is mainly used along with network tools such as Nmap.

```bash
proxychains nmap 192.168.1.10
```

If you want complete anonymity on the internet, Proxychains is the best tool that you can use.
